Put your project proposals here, naming the files `LastName-project-proposal.md` (replace `LastName` with your last name).

Submit the files by using the "Create new file" button, which will allow you to copy-paste your text into a new file, which will be submitted as a pull request. (Unfortunately, the "upload files" button doesn't work like this, and requires you to have write permissions for the repo.)

Alternatively, you can:
1. Fork the repo into your own account (use the "Fork" button)
2. Clone a local copy to your computer
3. Add the file in the proposals folder, and commit this addition
4. Push the change to your version of the repo (`git push`)
5. On your repo at GitHub, submit a new pull request back to the original “upstream” repo.
